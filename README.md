Hi there! This ReadME is still under contruction, but above you will find my bechdel project. Here, I worked in a team to create a program that examines gender representation in
media using computational methods like the Bechdel test, which measures whether a movie or TV show portrays women in a context separate from that of men. Hope you enjoy!
